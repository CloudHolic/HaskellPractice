HaskellPractice
==============

This project collects some simple Haskell codes for educational purpose.  
You can run *ghci* and then type *:load (filename.hs)* to load each files in Haskell interpreter.

There's a compile error at line 37 in **10/concurrency.hs**.  
I don't know how to fix it... Any idea?
